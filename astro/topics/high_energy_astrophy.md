* [__Stingray__ - X-Ray Spectral Timing Made Easy](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray)
    - __Stingray__ is an in-development spectral-timing software package for astrophysical X-ray (and more) data
    - Based on the work by [D. Huppenkothen et al. 2019: Stingray: A Modern Python Library For Spectral Timing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07681)

* [__gamma-sky__ - Portal to the gamma-ray sky](http://gamma-sky.net/)
    - __gamma-sky.net__ is a novel interactive website designed for exploring the gamma-ray sky. It is geared towards both professional astronomers and the general public.

* [__gammapy__ - A Python package for gamma-ray astronomy](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy)
    - __Gammapy__ is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy. It is a prototype for the CTA science tools
    - [Online document can be found here](https://docs.gammapy.org/0.12/)

* [__Enrico__ - helps you with your Fermi data analysis](https://github.com/gammapy/enrico)
    - Produce spectra (model fit and flux points), maps and lightcurves for your target simply by editing a config file and running a python script which executes the Fermi science tool chain.

* [__gamma-cat__ - An open data collection and source catalog for gamma-ray astronomy](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/gammacat)
    - __Gamma-Cat__ provides the gamma-ray data as 1) a full data collection (often multiple measurements, e.g. spectra, for a given source); 2) a source catalog (a simple table with one source per row, and a small subset of available data)

* [__threeML__ - The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML)](https://github.com/threeML/threeML)
    - Depends on [__astromodels__ - Spatial and spectral models for astrophysics](https://github.com/threeML/astromodels)
    - A framework for multi-wavelength/multi-messenger analysis for astronomy/astrophysics
    - Can help deal with X-ray and Gamma-ray observations.
