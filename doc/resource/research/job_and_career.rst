   appreciated.

Can I haz a job? General Career Advice
--------------------------------------

-  Getting an acedemic job is never easy, but at least you can prepare
   these things:

-  `Choose Your Own Adventure: Developing A Values-Oriented Framework
   for Your Career by Lucianne
   Walkowicz <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09963>`__

   -  I think you should read this, every word of it, before you read
      anything else. This is probably the best career advice I have ever
      read. I worked on my **mission statement** right after I read
      this.

-  `FindingAda website has a nice poster: What kind of technologist
   could I
   be? <https://findingada.com/blog/2018/10/08/new-careers-poster-what-kind-of-technologist-could-i-be/>`__

   -  “The poster aims to explode the idea that the only people who work
      in tech are programmers, and that traditionally female-coded
      roles, such as Teacher, Communicator and Facilitator are ‘not
      really tech jobs’.”
   -  “The role descriptions are left intentionally general so that
      students can more easily explore the nuances of different jobs
      within each category.”
   -  Many of these roles also apply to researchers or person with an
      academic background.

-  `Brown University’s
   CareerLAB <https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/>`__
   has a few nice guidance for finding job inside and outside academia:

   -  `Finding a job in
      academia <https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%202.pdf>`__
   -  `The Application Packet for an Academic Position Part
      I <https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%203.pdf>`__
      and `Part
      II <https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%204.pdf>`__
   -  `Outside Academia – Finding a Job in Industry, Business, or
      Nonprofits <https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%205.pdf>`__

-  Astrobites also have some nice career inside and outside astronomy
   (use **Career Navigation** as keyword):

      Science <https://astrobites.org/2016/06/01/alternative-careers-leveraging-your-astronomy-degree-for-data-science/>`__

Stay in Academia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Pathways to Success - A Holistic Approach to Professional
   Development from Cornell
   University <https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academic-progress/pathways-to-success/>`__

   -  The name sounds like a cliché, but some of the advice here is
      pretty good.

-  `Advice from a Faculty Hiring Committee
   Chair <https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2017/01/19/advice-from-a-faculty-hiring-committee-chair/>`__
-  `Advice for Aspiring Astrophysicists by Katie

   -  These are some very good tips.

Searching for Astronomy Related Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `AAS Job Register <https://jobregister.aas.org/>`__

   -  Probably the most important website if you want to find a post-doc
      or faculty job.

-  Astrophysics Jobs Rumor Mil

   -  For `faculty and
      staff <http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Rumor+Mill+Faculty-Staff>`__
   -  For `postdoc and term
      job <http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Rumor+Mill>`__
   -  Make sure that you don’t spend too much time here during the job
      season.

Resources and Tools for Job Application
---------------------------------------

To Apply for an Academic Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CV (Resume) and Publication List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Guide to use `resumes and CVs from Cornell
   University <https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academic-progress/pathways-to-success/prepare-for-your-career/take-action/resumes-and-cvs/>`__
-  You can make a CV using whatever software you want (e.g. Word,
   Pages), but LaTeX makes very nice and professional looking CV.
-  There are a good selection of `LaTeX CV templates on
   Overleaf <https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv>`__. Some of
   these are a little too fancy for acedemic, but they all look pretty
   good.

Personal Website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  It is actually pretty important to have a visible personal website
   that links your CV and contact information. Make sure that it can be
   found by search engine.
-  This is especially important if you try to find job in another
   country (e.g. get a PhD in China, want a post-doc job in Europe) or
   when you know the hiring committee is not familiar with you.

-  `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__ is pretty good choice to
   make a nice-looking personal website. And there are some `easy-to-use
   templates available <https://pages.github.com/themes/>`__, and there
   are `more fancy ones
   available <https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-templates>`__

   -  `How to Create a Simple Academic
      Website <https://marisacarlos.com/pages/create-simple-academic-website>`__

-  Good examples (personal choice: clean and informative)

   -  `Adrian Price-Whelan <http://adrian.pw/>`__; the code can be found
      `here <https://github.com/adrn/adrn.github.io>`__
   -  `Dan Foreman-Mackey <https://dfm.io/>`__; the code can be found
      `here <https://github.com/dfm/dfm.io>`__
