Spectroscopic Data Reduction and Analysis
=========================================

General Tools
-------------

-  `specutils - An Astropy coordinated package for astronomical
   spectroscopy <https://github.com/astropy/specutils>`__

   -  Provides a shared set of Python representations of astronomical
      spectra and basic tools to operate on these spectra.

-  `linetools - This is a package for the analysis of 1d astronomical
   spectra, especially quasar and galaxy
   spectra <https://github.com/linetools/linetools>`__

   -  Still under development. Its core developers work primarily on
      UV/optical/IR absorption line research, so most of the
      functionality is aimed at the identification and analysis of
      absorption lines. The eventual goal is to provide a set of tools
      useful for both absorption and emission lines.

      here <https://linetools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

Visualization
-------------

-  `specviz - An interactive astronomical 1D spectra analysis
   tool <https://github.com/spacetelescope/specviz>`__

   -  Made by STScI. An gui-based interactive analysis tool for one
      dimensional astronomical data using Python.

-  `cubeviz - Data analysis package for
   cubes <https://github.com/spacetelescope/cubeviz>`__

   -  Made by STScI. **CubeViz**, a visualization and analysis tool for
      data cubes from integral field units (IFUs). `Online document is
      here <https://cubeviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

Data Reduction Pipeline
-----------------------

-  `Pypelt - The Python Spectroscopic Data Reduction
   Pipeline <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt>`__

   -  PypeIt is a Python based data reduction pipeline (DRP) written
      oringinally for echelle spectroscopy and since expanded to
      low-resolution spectrometers.
   -  `arclines - Database of arc lines from optical-IR
      spectrographs <https://github.com/pypeit/arclines>`__

-  MaNGA data reduction and analysis pipeline

   -  `mangadap - The MaNGA Data Analysis
      Pipeline <https://github.com/sdss/mangadap>`__

      -  The MaNGA data-analysis pipeline (MaNGA DAP) is the survey-led
         software package that analyzes the data produced by the MaNGA
         data-reduction pipeline (MaNGA DRP) to produced physical
         properties derived from the MaNGA spectroscopy.

-  `GIST - Galaxy IFU Spectroscopy
   Tool <https://abittner.gitlab.io/thegistpipeline/index.html>`__

   -  A convenient, all-in-one framework for the scientific analysis of
      fully reduced, (integral-field) spectroscopic data.

-  `TDOSE - Three Dimensional Optimal Spectral
   Extraction <https://github.com/kasperschmidt/TDOSE>`__

   -  Python pipeline to extract spectra of both point sources and
      extended sources from integral field data cubes

-  `pydis - A simple longslit spectroscopy pipeline in
   Python <https://github.com/TheAstroFactory/pydis>`__

   -  The goal of pyDIS is to provide a turn-key solution for reducing
      and understanding longslit spectroscopy, which could ideally be
      done in real time. Currently we are using many simple assumptions
      to get a quick-and-dirty solution, and modeling the workflow after
      the robust industry standards set by IRAF.

-  `speclite - Lightweight utilities for working with spectroscopic
   data <https://github.com/dkirkby/speclite>`__

   -  By David Kirby. This package provides a set of lightweight
      utilities for working with spectroscopic data in astronomy.

Redshift or Radial Velocity Measurement
---------------------------------------

-  `grizli - Grism redshift & line analysis software for space-based
   slitless spectroscopy <https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli>`__

   -  By `Gabriel Brammer <http://www.stsci.edu/~brammer/>`__.

-  `redrock - Redshift fitting for
   spectroperfectionism <https://github.com/desihub/redrock>`__

   -  This is DESIâ€™s redshift measurement tool

-  `redmonster - Python utilieties for redshift
   measurement <https://github.com/timahutchinson/redmonster>`__

   -  **redmonster** is a project to develop a sophisticated and
      flexible set of Python utilities for redshift measurement,
      physical parameter measurement, and classification of
      one-dimensional astronomical spectra.
   -  Originally designed for eBOSS and the paper can be `found
      here <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02432>`__
