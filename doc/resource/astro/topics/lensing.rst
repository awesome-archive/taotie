All about Lensing: Strong, Weak, and Micro
==========================================

Strong Lensing
--------------

Modeling
~~~~~~~~

-  `PyAutoLens - Automated Strong Gravitational Lens
   Modeling <https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens>`__

   -  From James Nightingale. Based on `Adaptive Semi-linear Inversion
      of Strong Gravitational Lens
      Imaging <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7436>`__ and `AutoLens:
      Automated Modeling of a Strong Lens’s Light, Mass and
      Source <https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377>`__

-  `lenstronomy - Software package for lens model reconstruction of
   imaging data <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`__

   -  By Simon Birrer. **lenstronomy** is a multi-purpose package to
      model strong gravitational lenses.
   -  Based on `Lenstronomy: multi-purpose gravitational lens modelling
      software package <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1>`__

-  `vislens - Module for modeling gravitational lensing systems in which
   the data are not images but interferometric
   visibilities <https://github.com/jspilker/visilens>`__

   -  **Visilens** is a python module for modeling gravitational lensing
      systems observed by a radio/mm interferometer like ALMA or ATCA.

Weak Lensing
------------

-  Some of the tools overlap with the cosmology tools section.

Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `xshear - Measure the tangential shear around a set of
   lenses <https://github.com/esheldon/xshear>`__

   -  By Erin Sheldon. Measure the tangential shear around a set of
      lenses. This technique is also known as cross-correlation shear,
      hence the name xshear.

-  `dsigma - Pure-python galaxy-galaxy lensing framework for the HSC
   survey <https://github.com/dr-guangtou/dsigma>`__

   -  By Song Huang. **dsigma** is a pure-python galaxy-galaxy lensing
      pipeline designed for the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey. It should be
      flexible enough to work with other surveys after adapting the same
      data format.

-  `swot - Super W of Theta <https://jeancoupon.com/swot>`__

   -  SWOT is a code to compute two-point statistics for very large data
      sets, based on “divide and conquer” algorithms. `Github repo is
      here <https://github.com/jcoupon/swot>`__
   -  Is a great tool to do galaxy-galaxy lensing.
