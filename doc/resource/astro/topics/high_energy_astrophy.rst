--------------

-  `Stingray - X-Ray Spectral Timing Made
   Easy <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`__

   -  **Stingray** is an in-development spectral-timing software package
      for astrophysical X-ray (and more) data
   -  Based on the work by `D. Huppenkothen et al. 2019: Stingray: A
      Modern Python Library For Spectral
      Timing <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07681>`__

-  `gamma-sky - Portal to the gamma-ray sky <http://gamma-sky.net/>`__

   -  **gamma-sky.net** is a novel interactive website designed for
      exploring the gamma-ray sky. It is geared towards both
      professional astronomers and the general public.

-  `gammapy - A Python package for gamma-ray
   astronomy <https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy>`__

   -  **Gammapy** is a community-developed, open-source Python package
      for gamma-ray astronomy. It is a prototype for the CTA science
      tools
   -  `Online document can be found
      here <https://docs.gammapy.org/0.12/>`__

-  `Enrico - helps you with your Fermi data
   analysis <https://github.com/gammapy/enrico>`__

   -  Produce spectra (model fit and flux points), maps and lightcurves
      for your target simply by editing a config file and running a
      python script which executes the Fermi science tool chain.
   -  `Online document can be found
      here <https://enrico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

-  `gamma-cat - An open data collection and source catalog for gamma-ray
   astronomy <https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/gammacat>`__

   -  **Gamma-Cat** provides the gamma-ray data as 1) a full data
      collection (often multiple measurements, e.g. spectra, for a given
      source); 2) a source catalog (a simple table with one source per
      row, and a small subset of available data)

-  `threeML - The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework
   (3ML) <https://github.com/threeML/threeML>`__

   -  Depends on `astromodels - Spatial and spectral models for
      astrophysics <https://github.com/threeML/astromodels>`__
   -  A framework for multi-wavelength/multi-messenger analysis for
      astronomy/astrophysics
   -  Can help deal with X-ray and Gamma-ray observations.
