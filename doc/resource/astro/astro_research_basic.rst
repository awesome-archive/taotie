Basic Tools for Astrophysical Research
======================================

Data format used in astronomy
-----------------------------

-  `Flexible Image Transport System
   (FITS) <https://archive.stsci.edu/fits/>`__

   -  The default standard for the exchange of data in astronomy now
   -  The `full document of
      FITS <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/users_guide/usersguide.pdf>`__
      and `the MAST data format
      guidelines <https://archive.stsci.edu/data_format.html>`__
   -  `CFITSIO <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/>`__ is a library
      of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and writing data files in
      FITS.
   -  `astropy.io.fits <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/>`__
      can help you deal with FITS files in Python

-  `Advanced Scientific Data Format
   (ASDF) <https://github.com/spacetelescope/asdf>`__

   -  Next generation interchange format for scientific data developed
      by STScI
   -  It follows the new `ASDF
      Standard <https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

-  `HDF5 - High-performance data management and storage
   suite <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`__

   -  In the age of big data, HDF5 format is also becoming more popular
      in astronomy. For example, many hydro-simulations use HDF5 to
      store large and complex data.
   -  `h5py is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data
      format <https://www.h5py.org/>`__
   -  `fits2hdf is a FITS to HDFITS conversion
      utility <https://github.com/telegraphic/fits2hdf>`__

-  If you use Python, it is also convenient to use the
   `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__ and
   `dill <https://pypi.org/project/dill/>`__ (an even better **pickle**)
   module for serializing and de-serializing python objects to the
   majority of the built-in python types.

World Coordinate Systems (WCS)
------------------------------

-  `FITS World Coordinate System
   (WCS) <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html>`__

   -  `wcslib <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/wcslib/index.html>`__
      is a C library, supplied with a full set of Fortran wrappers, that
      implements the “World Coordinate System” (WCS) standard in FITS
   -  All the tools that deals with FITS format can also deal with WCS
      information (normally stored in the header). For example, the
      `astropy.wcs <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/>`__

-  `Generalized World Coordinate
   System <https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

   -  `gwcs - provides tools for managing WCS in a general
      way <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`__

-  `stwcs - WCS based distortion models and coordinate
   transformation <https://github.com/spacetelescope/stwcs>`__
-  `tweakwcs - Algorithms for matching and aligning catalogs and for
   tweaking the WCS so as to minimize catalog mismatch
   errors <https://github.com/spacetelescope/tweakwcs>`__

   -  **tweakwcs** is a package that provides core algorithms for
      computing and applying corrections to WCS objects such as to
      minimize mismatch between image and reference catalogs. Currently
      only aligning images with FITS WCS and JWST gWCS are supported.
