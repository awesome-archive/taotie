-  `Huterer et al. 2015 - Growth of cosmic structure: Probing dark
   energy beyond
   expansion <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015APh....63...23H>`__

   -  See Section 4.2: Cluster Abundance
   -  The primary importance of clusters in the context of dark energy
      is their complementarity to geometric probes, i.e. their **ability
      to distinguish between modified gravity and dark energy models
      with degenerate expansion histories**. Galaxy clusters are
      statistically competitive with and often better than other probes.
      (Fig 5, right panel, the “sweet spot” is z=0.3 - 0.8.
   -  The basic physics behind cluster abundances as a cosmological
      probe are **conceptually simple**; and A cluster abundance
      experiment is **conceptually very simple**.
   -  The dependence of the number of galaxy clusters on the **variance
      of the linear density field** that allows us to utilize galaxy
      clusters to constrain the growth of structure.
   -  Future surveys will almost certainly rely on **weak lensing mass
      calibration** to estimate cluster masses.
   -  Other usages of clusters as a cosmological tool:

      -  Galaxy clusters can probe dark energy in other ways as well,
         most notably by **comparing cluster mass estimates from weak
         lensing and dynamical methods such as galaxy velocity
         dispersions**
      -  Because the growth of structure is also impacted by non-zero
         neutrino mass, galaxy cluster abundances can provide
         **competitive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses**.

   -  Difficulties and limitations:

      -  To achieve the goal of DES Stage III (IV) requirement, we must
         be able to measure cluster masses with **5% (2%) precision**.
         See `Applegate et al.
         (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.439...48A>`__
         (Currently can achieve 7%, but with 20% systematic differences
         among methods).
      -  Systematic errors in shear measurements tend to be less
         critical for cluster abundance work than for cosmic shear work
         (only care about circular averaged tangential shear).
      -  Key systematic is the **calibration not only of the mean
         relation between cluster observables (optical, X-ray, or mm
         signals) and cluster mass, but also the scatter (shape and
         amplitude) about the mean.**
      -  **Cluster centering** remains an important systematic in
         optical and/or low resolution experiments (e.g. Planck). (See
         `Oguri & Takada 2011 about
         self-calibration <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhRvD..83b3008O>`__).
      -  Optical observations benefit from a lower mass detection
         threshold than X-ray/mm over a large redshift range, which in
         turn result in improved statistical constraints.
      -  **The synergistic nature of multi-wavelength cluster cosmology
         will necessarily play a key role in future cluster abundance
         experiments.** A balanced multi-wavelength approach will be
         critical to the success of cluster cosmology over the next
         10–20 years.
      -  **Self-calibration**: the cluster-clustering signal is itself
         an observable that one can use to calibrate cluster masses, and
         which is insensitive to all of the above systematic effects.

   probes, consistency
   tests <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RPPh...81a6901H>`__

   -  See Section 5.5 Galaxy Clusters
   -  Clusters are **versatile probes of cosmology and astrophysics**
      and have had an important role in the development of modern
      cosmology
   -  Recent cluster observations typically do not have enough
      signal-to-noise to determine the cluster masses directly; instead,
      **forward-modeling** can be applied to the mass function to recast
      the theory in the space of observable quantities (e.g. see Evrard
      et al. 2014).
   -  The mass function’s near-exponential dependence on the power
      spectrum in the high-mass limit is at the root of the power of
      clusters to probe the growth of density fluctuations.
   -  (The clusters’) two-point correlation function probes the matter
      power spectrum as well as the growth and geometry factors
      sensitive to dark energy.
   -  Clusters can also be correlated with background galaxies to probe
      the growth (Cluster-Galaxy lensing, see `Oguri & Takada
      2011 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhRvD..83b3008O>`__
   -  The most important uncertainty is typically tied to parameters
      that describe the scaling relations between mass and observable
      properties of the cluster (e.g. Flux, temperature).

   cluster survey with eROSITA: constraints from counts and
   clustering <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481..613P>`__

   -  Fisher information is extracted from the number density and
      spatial clustering of a photon-count-limited sample of clusters of
      galaxies up to z ˜ 2. We consider different scenarios for the
      availability of (i) X-ray follow-up observations, (ii) photometric
      and spectroscopic redshifts, and (iii) accurate knowledge of the
      observable - mass relation down to the scale of galaxy groups, but
      no additional observation-related systematics are taken into
      account.

Systematic, (Self-)Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `Lima & Hu 2004 - Self-calibration of cluster dark energy studies:
   Counts in
   cells <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PhRvD..70d3504L>`__

   -  **Important** Self-calibration (Using noise as signal!): **The
      excess variance of counts due to the clustering of clusters**
      provides such an opportunity and can be measured from the survey
      without additional observational cost.

-  `Lima & Hu 2005 - Self-calibration of cluster dark energy studies:
   Observable-mass
   distribution <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PhRvD..72d3006L>`__

   -  Given the shape of the actual mass function, the properties of the
      distribution may be internally monitored by the shape of the
      observable mass function.

-  `Hu & Cohn 2006 - Likelihood methods for cluster dark energy
   surveys <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006PhRvD..73f7301H>`__
-  `Lima & Hu 2007 - Photometric redshift requirements for
   self-calibration of cluster dark energy
   studies <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PhRvD..76l3013L>`__

   -  Self-calibration in combination with external mass inferences
      helps reduce photo-z requirements and provides important
      consistency checks for future cluster surveys.

-  `Majumdar & Mohr 2003 - Importance of Cluster Structural Evolution in
   Using X-Ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect Galaxy Cluster Surveys to
   Study Dark
   Energy <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...585..603M>`__

   -  We show that for a particular X-ray survey (Sunyaev-Zeldovich
      effect [SZE] survey), the constraints on w degrade by roughly a
      factor of 3 (factor of 2) when one accounts for the possibility of
      nonstandard cluster evolution.

   Energy: Combining the Cluster Redshift Distribution, the Power
   Spectrum, and Mass
   Measurements <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...613...41M>`__

   -  The best constraints are obtained when one combines both the power
      spectrum constraints and the mass measurements with the cluster
      redshift distribution; when using the survey to extract the
      parameters and evolution of the mass-observable relations, we
      estimate uncertainties on w of ~4%-6%

-  `Hu 2003 - Self-consistency and calibration of cluster number count
   surveys for dark
   energy <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PhRvD..67h1304H>`__

   -  “we find that the ambiguity from the normalization of the
      mass-observable relationships, or an extrapolation of external
      mass-observable determinations from higher masses, can be largely
      eliminated with a sufficiently deep survey, even allowing for an
      arbitrary evolution”

   Self-Calibration in Galaxy Cluster
   Surveys <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...688..729W>`__

   -  **Halo assembly bias**: the clustering amplitude of halos depends
      not only on the halo mass, but also on various secondary
      variables.
   -  The impact of the secondary dependence is determined by (1) the
      scatter in the observable-mass relation and (2) the correlation
      between observable and secondary variables. **Could be important
      to DES and LSST like survey**

-  `Cunha 2009 - Cross-calibration of cluster mass
   observables <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhRvD..79f3009C>`__

   -  We use a **Fisher matrix analysis** to study the improvements in
      the joint dark energy and cluster mass-observables constraints
      resulting from combining cluster counts and clustering abundances
      measured with different techniques.
   -  The **cross-calibrated constraints** are less sensitive to
      variations in the mass threshold or maximum redshift range.

   clusters: Complementarity with other
   probes <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhRvD..80f3532C>`__

   -  We find that optimally combined optical and Sunyaev-Zeldovich
      effect cluster surveys should improve the Dark Energy Task Force
      figure of merit

   Improvement of the Dark Energy Figure of Merit for Optical Galaxy
   Cluster
   Surveys <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713.1207W>`__

   -  Considering clusters selected from optical imaging in the Dark
      Energy Survey, we find that approximately 200 low-redshift X-ray
      clusters or massive Sunyaev-Zel’dovich clusters can improve the
      dark energy figure of merit by 50%, provided that the follow-up
      mass measurements involve no systematic error.

   -  We derive closed-form expressions for the space density of haloes
      as a function of multiple observables as well as forms for the
      low-order moments of properties of observable-selected samples.

   -  **Important**: We find that correlated large-scale structure
      within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but
      nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic
      scatter due to these physical sources is ≈20% for massive clusters
      and can be as high as ≈30% for group-sized systems.
   -  We find that WL mass measurements can have a small, ≈5%-10%, but
      non-negligible amount of bias.

   -  Number of galaxy clusters as a function of halo mass measures the
      amount of structure in the Universe (sigma_8).
   -  Optical selection allows detection of low mass systems; more
      abundant == better weak lensing halo mass == Better cosmology.
      Finding clusters in the optical maximizes the cosmological
      information that can be drawn from clusters.
