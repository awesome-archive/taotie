Basic Reference for Learning Python
===================================

There are clearly too many guide and tutorial for Python, some of which
are quite good. Here is just a personal selection.

--------------

Basic
-----

-  `Hitchhiker’s Guide to
   Python <https://github.com/realpython/python-guide>`__

   -  The actual guide book is `here <docs.python-guide.org>`__

-  `A Byte of Python <https://python.swaroopch.com/>`__

   -  “A Byte of Python” is a free book on programming using the Python
      language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language
      for a beginner audience.

-  `Awesome Python <https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python>`__

   -  A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software
      and resources.

-  `Comprehensive Python
   Cheatsheet <https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/>`__

   -  Made by `Jure Šorn <https://github.com/gto76>`__. The `source
      files are here <https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet>`__

Dig Deeper
----------

-  `All Algorithms implemented in
   Python <https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python>`__

   -  These implementations are for learning purposes. They may be less
      efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.

-  Python Standard Library is a very good place to start learning
   Python:

   -  There are a lot of useful tools in the standard library.
   -  `A brief tour of the standard
      library <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#operating-system-interface>`__
   -  `The Reference of the Python Standard
      Library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>`__

Managing Python Packages
------------------------

`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Anaconda** distribution is the easiest way to perform Python/R data
   science and machine learning on all platforms. It can help you create
   environments with different Python versions, and manage libraries and
   dependencies in Python.

   -  It is an easy way to start with Python programming without
      worrying too much about installing packages all by yourself.
   -  `Getting started with
      Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/>`__
      and the `Anaconda
      tutorials <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/>`__
      are good places to start.

-  `AstroConda - Conda for
   astronomers <https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

   -  **AstroConda** is a free Conda channel maintained by the Space
      Telescope Science Institute (STScI) ### **pip**: Python Package
      Installer

-  One important reason to use **Python** in science is that there are
   already a huge number of great tools prepared to make your life
   easier.
-  The most useful tool is `pip - The Python Package
   Installer <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__.

   -  **pip** is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to
      install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes
   -  `This complete reference
      guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/>`__ is very
      useful.
   -  `What Is Pip? A Guide for New
      Pythonistas <https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/>`__

-  `pip-tools - A set of tools to keep your pinned Python dependencies
   fresh <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`__

   -  A set of command line tools to help you keep your pip-based
      packages fresh, even when you’ve pinned them.
