# Astro README.md

* This is a collection of very good intro-level notes/lectures/manuals that cover a broad range of topics. Although it is not possible to read all of them before you do research, but it is helpful to know they exist.

## Online or Free Textbook

## User Manual for Astronomer

* Below is a list of (relative short) manual, guide, tutorial on some specific but important topics in astrophysical research. You don't need to read all of them (although you are encouraged to do so...), but you should know they are available.
