Tao Tie (饕餮) - A curated collection of resources for astrophysical research
=============================================================================

    “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou 
    dynasty...In ancient Chinese mythology like "Classic of Mountains and Seas", the "taotie" (饕餮) 
    is one of the "four evil creatures of the world"...a greedy and gluttonous son of the Jinyun 
    clan, who lived during the time of the 
    legendary Yellow Emperor.” - `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie>`_ 
    
    "缙云氏有不才子，贪于饮食，冒于货贿，天下谓之饕餮" 
    - `《吕氏春秋·先识》 <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A5%95%E9%A4%AE>`_

Motivation and Goals
--------------------

* Over the past ~10 years, I have gradually accumulated some useful resources for 
  astrophysical research and I believe the best way to make use of these information is 
  to share them.
* The name ``taotie`` (饕餮) refers to a greedy and gluttonous monster in ancient Chinese myth. 
  It is indeed very greedy and over-ambitious to collect all useful resources for astrophysics 
  and cosmology.
* **The goal of ``taotie``** is to become a curated list of resources for astronomy and 
  astrophysics maintained by the community. Just like many other ``awesome`` lists available 
  on ``GitHub``. We hope ``taotie`` can become the first stop for new student or researcher in 
  astronomy to seek for practical guidance and experience.  
  And ``taotie`` can also be a handy and organized "bookmark" for researchers in different fields.

Progress and Plans
------------------

* **Under Construction**: This repo is still under heavy and frequent development. 
  I am currently working on this as a weekend project.
* Currently working on improving the collections of ``taotie``, especially for research fields 
  outside my personal comfort zone. **Any help will be highly appreciated!**
* Also working on improving the presentation by making a user-friendly website based on a list 
  of markdown files.

On Using ``taotie`` (饕餮)
--------------------------

* Now ``taotie`` is available on both `GitHub <https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie>`_ 
  and `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/dr-guangtou/taotie>`_.  
  And you can also find ``taotie`` using `this address <https://dr-guangtou.github.io/taotie/>`_
* For users in mainland China: in case the ``Github`` link below is not available, 
  please replace ``github`` with ``gitlab`` and try again. 
  **Please let me know if you have trouble accessing both sites**.
* The main language for ``taotie`` is English. Some of the important documents will be slowly 
  translated into Chinese.
* **Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation**.
