Gaia
====

-  *Gaia* is an ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of
   our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process revealing the composition,
   formation and evolution of the Galaxy. *Gaia* will provide
   unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements with the
   accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of
   about one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout the Local Group.
   This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population.

-  Right now we are at *Gaia* DR2 (06/2019)

Important Documents:
--------------------

Special Issues:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  There are too many important publications about the *Gaia* mission,
   instrument, data reduction, and data release. Most of these
   “official” publications are compiled into two special issues of the
   Astronomy & Astrophysics:

   -  `A&A Special Issue: Gaia Data Release
      1 <https://www.aanda.org/component/toc/?task=topic&id=641>`__
   -  `A&A Special Issue: Gaia Data Release
