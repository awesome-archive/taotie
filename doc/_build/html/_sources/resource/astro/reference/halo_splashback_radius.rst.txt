Splashback Radius of Dark Matter Halo
=====================================

Introduction
------------

-  Read the introduction by `Benedikt Diemer on his
   webpage <http://www.benediktdiemer.com/research/splashback/>`__: >
   “…A more natural halo boundary is provided by the splashback radius,
   :math:`R_{\rm sp}`, the radius where particles reach the apocenter of
   their first orbit after infall…Particles at the apocenter of their
   first orbit pile up due to their low radial velocity, creating a
   caustic that manifests itself as a sharp drop in the density profile.
   This so-called splashback radius represents a clear boundary between
   matter orbiting in the halo and matter on a first infall toward the
   halo.”

      radius, a sharp halo edge corresponding to the location of the
      first orbital apocenter of satellite galaxies after their infall.”

      signiture, consistent with first infall

   -  “While the orientation dependence at small scales is ascribed to
      the halo triaxiality, our results indicate even stronger
      orientation dependence in the so-called two-halo regime”
