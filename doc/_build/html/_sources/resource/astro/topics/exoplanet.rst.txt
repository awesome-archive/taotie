Exoplanet and Astrobiology
==========================

-  **Just started**
-  **Help wanted**: I am not very familiar with this topic, but it
   clearly has become one of the most important field in astronomy.

   -  By Néstor Espinoza. The EXOplanet traNsits and rAdIal veLocity
      fittER (**EXO-NAILER**), is an easy-to-use code that allows you to
      efficiently fit exoplanet transit lightcurves, radial velocities
      (RVs) or both.

-  `batman - Bad-Ass Transit Model
   cAlculatioN <http://astro.uchicago.edu/~kreidberg/batman/>`__

   -  **batman**, a Python package for fast calculation of exoplanet
      transit light curves.
   -  Based on `the paper by Laura
      Kreidberg <https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08285>`__

Direct Imaging
--------------

-  `PynPoint - Pipeline for processing and analysis of high-contrast
   imaging data <https://github.com/PynPoint/PynPoint>`__

   -  **PynPoint** is a generic, end-to-end pipeline for the data
      reduction and analysis of high-contrast imaging data of planetary
      and substellar companions, as well as circumstellar disks in
      scattered light.

   -  By `Megan Bedell <https://bedell.space/>`__ **wobble** is an
      open-source python package for analyzing time-series spectra. It
      was designed with stabilized extreme precision radial velocity
      (EPRV) spectrographs in mind, but is highly flexible and
      extensible to a variety of applications.
