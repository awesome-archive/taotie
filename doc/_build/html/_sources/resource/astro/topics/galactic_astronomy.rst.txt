Galactic Astronomy and the Milky Way
====================================

-  **Just started**
-  Focusing on the dynamic and stellar population sides.

Galactic Dynamics
-----------------

Courses
~~~~~~~

-  `Dynamics and Astrophysics of Galaxies by Jo
   Bovy <http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/AST1420/notes/index.html#>`__
-  `Dynamics of Collisionless Systems by Frank van den
   Bosch <http://www.astro.yale.edu/vdbosch/galdyn.html>`__

Tools for Galactic Dynamic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `gala - Galactic and gravitational dynamics in
   Python <https://github.com/adrn/gala>`__

   -  By `Adrian Price-Whelan <http://adrian.pw/>`__. Provide a
      class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
      Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as
      gravitational potential and force evaluation, orbit integration,
      dynamical transformations, and chaos indicators for nonlinear
      dynamics.
   -  Online `document is here <http://gala.adrian.pw/en/latest/>`__

-  `galpy - Galactic Dynamics in
   Python <https://github.com/jobovy/galpy>`__

   -  By `Jo Bovy <http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/>`__. It supports
      orbit integration in a variety of potentials, evaluating and
      sampling various distribution functions, and the calculation of
      action-angle coordinates for all static potentials.
   -  Online `document is
      here <https://galpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/>`__

-  `thejoker - A custom Monte Carlo sampler for the (gravitational)
   two-body problem <https://github.com/adrn/thejoker>`__

   -  By Adrian Price-Whelan. The Joker [1] is a custom Monte Carlo
      sampler for the two-body problem and is therefore useful for
      constraining star-star or star-planet systems

-  `wendy - A one-dimensional gravitational N-body
   code <https://github.com/jobovy/wendy>`__

   -  By Jo Bovy. **wendy** solves the one-dimensional gravitational
      N-body problem to machine precision with an efficient algorithm
      [O(log N) / particle-collision]. Alternatively, it can solve the
      problem with approximate integration, but with exact forces.

-  `GALAXY N-body simulation
   package <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/galaxy/>`__

   -  By Jerry Sellwood. The
      `manual <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~sellwood/manual.pdf>`__
      is here.

-  `Agama - Action-based galaxy modeling
   framework <https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama>`__

   -  **Agama** is a library intended for a broad range of tasks within
      the field of stellar dynamics.

-  `NEMO - A Stellar Dynamics
   Toolbox <https://teuben.github.io/nemo/>`__

   -  By Peter Teuben. Also available on
      `github <https://github.com/teuben/nemo>`__

Jeans Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `JAM - Jeans Anisotropic MGE modeling
   method <http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/#jam>`__

   -  By Michelle Cappellari. Available in Python and IDL.

-  `CJAM - Jeans Anisotropic MGE modelling code written in
   C <https://github.com/lauralwatkins/cjam>`__

   -  By Laura Watkins. Extended JAM models to calculate all three (x,
      y, z) first moments and all six (xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz) second
      moments.

-  `slomo - Jeans modeling with multiple tracer
   populations <https://github.com/adwasser/slomo>`__

   -  By Asher Wasserman. There is also a Julia version:
      `Slomo.jl <https://github.com/adwasser/Slomo.jl>`__

Schwarzschild Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `TriaxSchwarzschild by Remco van den
   Bosch <https://github.com/remcovandenbosch/TriaxSchwarzschild>`__

   -  Fortran source codes.

Galactic Chemical Evolution
---------------------------

Models of Chemical Evolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `kimmy - Galactic chemical evolution in
   python <https://github.com/jobovy/kimmy>`__

   -  By Jo Bovy. **kimmy** contains simple tools to study chemical
      evolution in galaxies.

Spectra of Milky Way Stars
--------------------------

Spectroscopic Surveys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `APOGEE - The APO Galactic Evolution
   Experiment <https://www.sdss.org/surveys/apogee/>`__
-  `GALAH - GALactic Archaeology with
   HERMES <https://galah-survey.org/>`__

   -  Using HERMES on AAT. Resolution: R~28,000.

Stellar structures in the Milky Way
-----------------------------------

-  `galstreams - Milky Way Streams Footprint Library and Toolkit for
   Python <https://github.com/cmateu/galstreams>`__

   -  It includes a compilation of spatial information for known stellar
      streams and overdensities in the Milky Way (MW) and Python tools
      for visualizing them.
