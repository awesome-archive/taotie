Radio and Sub-millimeter Astronomy
==================================

**Just started**

--------------

-  `casacore - Suite of C++ libraries for radio astronomy data
   processing <https://github.com/casacore/casacore>`__

   -  The **casacore** package contains the core libraries of the old
      **AIPS++/CASA** package. This split was made to get a better
      separation of core libraries and applications. **CASA** is now
      built on top of **Casacore**.
   -  **python-casacore**: Python bindings for casacore, a library used
      in radio astronomy. Document can be `found
      here <http://casacore.github.io/python-casacore/>`__

-  `pyuvdata - A pythonic interface for radio astronomy interferometry
   data (uvfits, miriad,
   others) <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvdata>`__

   -  **pyuvdata** defines a pythonic interface to interferometric data
      sets. Currently pyuvdata supports reading and writing of miriad,
      uvfits, and uvh5 files and reading of **CASA** measurement sets
      and FHD (Fast Holographic Deconvolution) visibility save files.
   -  Online document is
      `here <https://pyuvdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

-  `pyuvsim - A comprehensive simulation package for radio
   interferometers in
   python <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvsim>`__

   -  A number of analysis tools are available to simulate the output of
      a radio interferometer (CASA, OSKAR, FHD, PRISim, et al), however
      each makes numerical approximations to enable speed ups.

-  `wise - Wavelet Image Segmentation and Evaluation
   tool <https://github.com/flomertens/wise>`__

   -  **wise** is developed to address the issue of detecting
      significant features in radio interferometric images and obtaining
      reliable velocity field from cross-correlation of these regions in
      multi-epoch observations.
   -  Detection of structural information is performed using the
      segmented wavelet decomposition (SWD) method.

-  `GaussPy - A Python tool for implementing Autonomous Gaussian
   Decomposition <https://github.com/gausspy/gausspy>`__

   -  Based on the work of `Autonomous Gaussian
      Decomposition <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2840>`__

-  `gausspyplus - Fully automated Gaussian decomposition package for
   emission line spectra <https://github.com/mriener/gausspyplus>`__

   -  **GaussPy+** is based on **GaussPy**: A python tool for
      implementing the Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition algorithm.

-  `Scintillometry - A Package for Radio Baseband Data
   Reduction <https://github.com/mhvk/scintillometry>`__

   -  **Scintillometry** is a package for reduction and analysis of
      radio baseband data, optimized for pulsar scintillometry science.
      `Online document is
      here <https://scintillometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

-  `SoFiA - The HI Source Finding
   Application <https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA>`__

   -  **SoFiA**, the Source Finding Application, is a new HI source
      finding pipeline intended to find and parametrise galaxies in HI
      data cubes.
   -  The version 2 which is reimplemented in **C** can be `found
      here <https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA-2>`__

-  `galario - Gpu Accelerated Library for Analysing Radio Interferometer
   Observations <https://github.com/mtazzari/galario>`__

   -  **galario** is a library that exploits the computing power of
      modern graphic cards (GPUs) to accelerate the comparison of model
      predictions to radio interferometer observations.
