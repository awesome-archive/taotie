   Physics <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-image>`__

   -  **sunkit-image** is a a open-source toolbox for solar physics
      image processing. Currently it is experimental library for various
      solar physics specific image processing routines.

Telescope or Mission Specific Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `irispy - A SunPy-affiliated package which provides tools to analyze
   data from IRIS <https://github.com/sunpy/irispy>`__

      to read in and analyze data from the IRIS solar-observing
      satellite in Python.

-  `drms - Access HMI, AIA and MDI data with
   Python <https://github.com/sunpy/drms>`__

   -  The **drms** module provides an easy-to-use interface for
      accessing HMI, AIA and MDI data with Python. It uses the publicly
      accessible JSOC DRMS server by default
