Resources and Tools for Numerical Method and Scientific Computing
=================================================================

Resources
---------

-  `Numerical Recipes - The Art of Scientific
   Computing <http://numerical.recipes/>`__

   -  The famous book. Algorithms available in Fortran, C, and C++.
   -  A `Second Edition of the C
      version <https://www.cec.uchile.cl/cinetica/pcordero/MC_libros/NumericalRecipesinC.pdf>`__
      is available here.
   -  `Numerical Recipes 2nd ed. ANSI C++
      Files <https://www.astro.umd.edu/~ricotti/NEWWEB/teaching/ASTR415/InClassExamples/NR3/legacy/nr2/CPP_211/index.htm>`__

-  `Awesome Scientific Computing - Curated list of awesome software for
   numerical
   analysis <https://github.com/nschloe/awesome-scientific-computing>`__

   -  Scientific computing and numerical analysis are research fields
      that aim to provide methods for solving large-scale problems from
      various areas of science with the help of computers.

Tools
-----

-  `meshio - I/O for various mesh
   formats <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__

   -  By Nico Schlömer. There are various mesh formats available for
      representing unstructured meshes. meshio can read and write a lot
      of them, and can convert among them.

-  `quadpy - Numerical integration (quadrature, cubature) in
   Python <https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy>`__

   -  By Nico Schlömer. More than 1500 numerical integration schemes for
      line segments, circles, disks, triangles, quadrilaterals, spheres,
      balls, tetrahedra, hexahedra, wedges, pyramids, n-spheres,
      n-balls, n-cubes, n-simplices, and the 1D/2D/3D/nD spaces with
      weight functions exp(-r) and exp(-r2) for fast integration of
      real-, complex-, and vector-valued functions.

-  `optimesh - Mesh optimization, mesh
   smoothing <https://github.com/nschloe/optimesh>`__

   -  By Nico Schlömer. Several mesh smoothing/optimization methods with
      one simple interface. Only works for triangular meshes
