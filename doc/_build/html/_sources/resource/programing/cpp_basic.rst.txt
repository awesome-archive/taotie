C++ Programming Language
========================

Learning C++
------------

-  **The best way to learn programming is, always, writing your own
   code!**

-  `CppCoreGuidelines - The C++ Core Guidelines are a set of
   tried-and-true guidelines, rules, and best practices about coding in
   C++ <https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines>`__

   -  The `website version is
      here <http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#main>`__
   -  The C++ Core Guidelines are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne
      Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result
      of many person-years of discussion and design across a number of
      organizations.
