Setting Up a Computer Environment for Research
==============================================

Terminal Tools
--------------

Terminal Emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `iTerm2 - macOS Terminal Replacement <https://www.iterm2.com/>`__

   -  A nice free choice for **MacOSX**.
      `iTerm2 <https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2>`__ brings the
      terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you
      always wanted.
   -  A `cheat sheet of iTerm2
      shortcuts <https://gist.github.com/squarism/ae3613daf5c01a98ba3a>`__

-  It becomes easier and easier to do research under Windows system:

   -  `Microsoft’s terminal - The new Windows Terminal, and the original
      Windows console host <https://github.com/microsoft/terminal>`__
   -  `cmder - Portable console emulator for
      Windows <https://cmder.net/>`__

-  Different Linux releases have there own default terminal emulator and
   normally they are good enough for research works. Meanwhile, there
   are some nice choices of drop-down style emulators:

   -  `tilda - A Gtk based drop down terminal for Linux and
      Unix <https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda>`__
   -  `guake - Drop-down terminal for
      GNOME <https://github.com/Guake/guake>`__

      -  **Guake** is a dropdown terminal made for the **GNOME** desktop
         environment. **Guake**\ ’s style of window is based on an FPS
         game, and one of its goals is to be easy to reach.

Terminal Multiplexer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `GNU Screen <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git>`__

   -  **Screen** is available in most Unix/Linux system release.

-  `tmux - a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating
   systems <https://github.com/tmux/tmux>`__

   -  Similar to **Screen**. There are a lot of discussions about the
      pros and cons of **Screen** and **tmux**, but as a beginner,
      either is fine.
   -  Read `A tmux crash
      course <https://thoughtbot.com/blog/a-tmux-crash-course>`__ and
      `tmux shortcuts and cheat
      sheet <https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058>`__ before you
      use it.
