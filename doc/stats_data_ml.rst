Statistics, Data Science, & Machine Learning
============================================

* As astronomy becomes more and more data intensive, as cosmology becomes more and more accurate,
  statistical modeling and even machine learning are becoming the most promising and perhaps the
  only way for astronomers to tackle increasingly difficult questions.
* Not all scientisits with a astronomy background are literate in the language of statistics, or
  (real) data science, or machine learning, it is important to acknowledge this and keep learning.
