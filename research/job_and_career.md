## Can I haz a job? General Career Advice

* Getting an acedemic job is never easy, but at least you can prepare these things:

* [Choose Your Own Adventure: Developing A Values-Oriented Framework for Your Career by Lucianne Walkowicz](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09963)
    - I think you should read this, every word of it, before you read anything else.  This is probably the best career advice I have ever read.  I worked on my **mission statement** right after I read this.

* [FindingAda website has a nice poster: What kind of technologist could I be?](https://findingada.com/blog/2018/10/08/new-careers-poster-what-kind-of-technologist-could-i-be/)
    - "The poster aims to explode the idea that the only people who work in tech are programmers, and that traditionally female-coded roles, such as Teacher, Communicator and Facilitator are ‘not really tech jobs’."
    - "The role descriptions are left intentionally general so that students can more easily explore the nuances of different jobs within each catgory." 
    - Many of these roles also apply to researchers or person with an academic background.

* [Brown University's CareerLAB](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/) has a few nice guidance for finding job inside and outside academia:
    - [Finding a job in academia](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%202.pdf)
    - [The Application Packet for an Academic Position Part I](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%203.pdf) and [Part II](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/DM_Chapter%204.pdf)

### Stay in Academia

* [Pathways to Success - A Holistic Approach to Professional Development from Cornell University](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academic-progress/pathways-to-success/)
    - The name sounds like a cliché, but some of the advice here is pretty good.
* [Advice from a Faculty Hiring Committee Chair](https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2017/01/19/advice-from-a-faculty-hiring-committee-chair/)
* [Advice for Aspiring Astrophysicists by Katie Mack](http://www.astrokatie.com/solicited-advice)

    - These are some very good tips.

#### Searching for Astronomy Related Jobs

* [AAS Job Register](https://jobregister.aas.org/)
    - Probably the most important website if you want to find a post-doc or faculty job.

* Astrophysics Jobs Rumor Mil
    - For [faculty and staff](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Rumor+Mill+Faculty-Staff)
    - For [postdoc and term job](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Rumor+Mill)

## Resources and Tools for Job Application

### To Apply for an Academic Position 

#### CV (Resume) and Publication List

* Guide to use [resumes and CVs from Cornell University](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academic-progress/pathways-to-success/prepare-for-your-career/take-action/resumes-and-cvs/)
* You can make a CV using whatever software you want (e.g. Word, Pages), but LaTeX makes very nice and professional looking CV.
* There are a good selection of [LaTeX CV templates on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv). Some of these are a little too fancy for acedemic, but they all look pretty good.

#### Personal Website

* It is actually pretty important to have a visible personal website that links your CV and contact information.  Make sure that it can be found by search engine.
* This is especially important if you try to find job in another country (e.g. get a PhD in China, want a post-doc job in Europe) or when you know the hiring committee is not familiar with you.

* [__GitHub Pages__](https://pages.github.com/) is pretty good choice to make a nice-looking personal website.  And there are some [easy-to-use templates available](https://pages.github.com/themes/), and there are [more fancy ones available](https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-templates)
    - [How to Create a Simple Academic Website](https://marisacarlos.com/pages/create-simple-academic-website)
