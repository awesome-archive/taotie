# Astrophysical and Cosmological Applications of Machine Learnings

* This is Jun, 2019, and an ADS search of "machine learning" in the abstract of referred astronomy journals result in **711** papers, so it is almost too late to try to "read everything"...but at least we can try:

* And, again, this list only reflects one person's taste.

## Galaxy Morphology

* [Morpheus: A Deep Learning Framework For Pixel-Level Analysis of Astronomical Image Data](https://morpheus-project.github.io/morpheus/)
    - By Ryan Hausen & Brant Robertson. Based on the [work here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11248.pdf). [Source code is on Github](https://github.com/morpheus-project/morpheus).
    * __Morpheus__ is a neural network model used to generate pixel-level morphological classifications for astronomical sources. This model can be used to generate segmentation maps or to inform other photometric measurements with granular morphological information. Built on __Tensorflow__.
    * [Online document is here](https://morpheus-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); and [this notebook](https://github.com/morpheus-project/morpheus/blob/master/examples/example_array.ipynb) is a good place to get started.

* [Rotation-invariant convolutional neural networks for galaxy morphology prediction](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.1441D/abstract)


## Photometric Redshift

* [TPZ: photometric redshift PDFs and ancillary information by using prediction trees and random forests](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1483C/abstract)
    - Decision tree and random forest.

## Cosmology

* [__ml-in-cosmology__ - a comprehensive list of published machine learning applications to cosmology](https://github.com/georgestein/ml-in-cosmology)
    - A beautiful list compiled by [George Stein](https://github.com/georgestein)
    - "Each entry contains the paper title, a simple summary of the machine learning methods used in the work, and the arxiv link"

* [__MiSTree__ - Beyond two-point statistics: using the Minimum Spanning Tree as a tool for cosmology](https://knaidoo29.github.io/mistreedoc/index.html)
    - The [public code can be found here](https://github.com/knaidoo29/mistree)
