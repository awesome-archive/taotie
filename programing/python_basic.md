# Basic Reference for Learning Python

 There are clearly too many guide and tutorial for Python, some of which are quite good. Here is just a personal selection.

----

## Basic

* [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://github.com/realpython/python-guide)
    - The actual guide book is [here](docs.python-guide.org)

* [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)
    - "A Byte of Python" is a free book on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience.

* [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)
    - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.

* [Comprehensive Python Cheatsheet](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/)
    - Made by [Jure Å orn](https://github.com/gto76). The [source files are here](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet)


## Dig Deeper

* [All Algorithms implemented in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)
    - These implementations are for learning purposes. They may be less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.

* Python Standard Library is a very good place to start learning Python:
    - There are a lot of useful tools in the standard library.
    - [A brief tour of the standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#operating-system-interface)
    - [The Reference of the Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)

## Managing Python Packages

### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

* __Anaconda__ distribution is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on all platforms. It can help you create environments with different Python versions, and manage libraries and dependencies in Python.
    - It is an easy way to start with Python programming without worrying too much about installing packages all by yourself.
    - [Getting started with __Anaconda__](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) and the [__Anaconda__ tutorials](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/) are good places to start.

* [__AstroConda__ - Conda for astronomers](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - __AstroConda__ is a free Conda channel maintained by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) 
### __pip__: Python Package Installer

* One important reason to use __Python__ in science is that there are already a huge number of great tools prepared to make your life easier.
* The most useful tool is [__pip__ - The Python Package Installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
    - __pip__ is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes
    - [This complete reference guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/) is very useful.
    - [What Is Pip? A Guide for New Pythonistas](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/)

* [__pip-tools__ - A set of tools to keep your pinned Python dependencies fresh](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
    - A set of command line tools to help you keep your pip-based packages fresh, even when you've pinned them.

## Start-up Package

* The most basic packages you want to use on daily bases.

* __Scipy__ ecosystem:

* [__matplotlib__ - Comprehensive 2D Plotting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
    - __Matplotlib__ is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
    - [Online document of __matplotlib__](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html); and the [__matplotlib__ gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) are very helpful resources to learn.

* [__Bokeh__ - ](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
    - __Bokeh__ is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.
    - [__Bokeh__ user guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html#userguide) and the [reference guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference.html#refguide) are very useful.
