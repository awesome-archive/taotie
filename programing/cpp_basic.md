# C++ Programming Language

## Learning C++

* **The best way to learn programming is, always, writing your own code!**

    - The [online reference manual can be found here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html).

* [__Eigen__ - a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

* [__Armadillo__ - C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
    - __Armadillo__ is a high quality linear algebra library (matrix maths) for the C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use

* [__xtensor__ - Multi-dimensional arrays with broadcasting and lazy computing](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor)
    - __xtensor__ is a C++ library meant for numerical analysis with multi-dimensional array expressions. __xtensor__ can be used to process NumPy data structures inplace using Python's buffer protocol.

### Optimization

* [__OptimLib__ - a lightweight C++ library of numerical optimization methods for nonlinear functions](https://github.com/kthohr/optim)
    - A C++11 library of local and global optimization algorithms, as well as root finding techniques, supporting a large number of algorithms.
