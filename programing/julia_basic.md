# The Julia Programming Language

* **Still highly imcomplete**
* High-level programming language for future astronomer....maybe?

----

## Basic Information

* [The JuliaLab@MIT](https://julia.mit.edu/)
* [The Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/)
    - Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance.
    - The source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
* [Julia 1.1 Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
* [Julia Observer](https://juliaobserver.com/packages)
    - Good place to search for useful tools.
* [Julia.jl - Curated decibans of Julia programming language](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl)
    - Check out the [Space-Science.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Space-Science.md) for astro-related packages.

### Distributions

* [JuliaPro - A Julia distribution crafted for your success](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html)

### Learning Materials

* [Learn Julia the hard way!](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/learn-julia-the-hard-way)
    - GitBook for learning Julia language.
* [Julia Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Julia-Cheat-Sheet)
    - The [one page version](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/)
* [JuliaZH.jl - Julia语言中文文档](https://github.com/JuliaCN/JuliaZH.jl)

## Useful Packages

### Basic

* [DataFrames.jl - In-memory tabular data in Julia](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl)
    - Tools for working with tabular data in Julia.
* [CSV.jl - Utility library for working with CSV and other delimited files in the Julia programming language ](https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl)
    - A fast, flexible delimited file reader/writer for Julia.
* [Genie.jl - The highly productive Julia web framework](https://github.com/GenieFramework/Genie.jl)
    - Genie is a full-stack MVC web framework that provides a streamlined and efficient workflow for developing modern web applications.

### Visualization

* [Plots.jl - Powerful convenience for Julia visualizations and data analysis](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
    - Documents can be found [here](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/)
* [Gadfly.jl - Crafty statistical graphics for Julia](https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Gadfly.jl)
    - Gadfly is a plotting and data visualization system written in Julia.

### Optimization

* [Optim.jl - Optimization functions for Julia](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl)
    - Optim.jl is a package for univariate and multivariate optimization of functions.
* [LsqFit.jl - Simple curve fitting in Julia](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/LsqFit.jl)
    - The LsqFit package is a small library that provides basic least-squares fitting in pure Julia under an MIT license.

### Statistics

* [Turing.jl - The Turing language for probabilistic programming](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl)
    - Turing allows the user to write models in standard Julia syntax, and provide a wide range of sampling-based inference methods for solving problems across probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics and data science etc.

### Machine Learning

* [Flux.jl - the ML library that doesn't make you tensor](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)
    - Flux is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.
* [knet.jl - Koç University deep learning framework](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl)
    - Knet (pronounced "kay-net") is the Koç University deep learning framework implemented in Julia by Deniz Yuret and collaborators
