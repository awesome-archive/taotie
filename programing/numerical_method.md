# Resources and Tools for Numerical Method and Scientific Computing

## Resources 

* [Numerical Recipes - The Art of Scientific Computing](http://numerical.recipes/)
    - The famous book.  Algorithms available in Fortran, C, and C++.
    - A [Second Edition of the C version](https://www.cec.uchile.cl/cinetica/pcordero/MC_libros/NumericalRecipesinC.pdf) is available here.
    - [Numerical Recipes 2nd ed. ANSI C++ Files](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~ricotti/NEWWEB/teaching/ASTR415/InClassExamples/NR3/legacy/nr2/CPP_211/index.htm)

* [Awesome Scientific Computing -  Curated list of awesome software for numerical analysis](https://github.com/nschloe/awesome-scientific-computing)
    - Scientific computing and numerical analysis are research fields that aim to provide methods for solving large-scale problems from various areas of science with the help of computers. 

## Tools

* [__meshio__ - I/O for various mesh formats](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio)
    - By Nico Schlömer. There are various mesh formats available for representing unstructured meshes. meshio can read and write a lot of them, and can convert among them.

* [__quadpy__ - Numerical integration (quadrature, cubature) in Python](https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy)
    - By Nico Schlömer. More than 1500 numerical integration schemes for line segments, circles, disks, triangles, quadrilaterals, spheres, balls, tetrahedra, hexahedra, wedges, pyramids, n-spheres, n-balls, n-cubes, n-simplices, and the 1D/2D/3D/nD spaces with weight functions exp(-r) and exp(-r2) for fast integration of real-, complex-, and vector-valued functions.

* [__optimesh__ - Mesh optimization, mesh smoothing](https://github.com/nschloe/optimesh)
    - By Nico Schlömer. Several mesh smoothing/optimization methods with one simple interface. Only works for triangular meshes
